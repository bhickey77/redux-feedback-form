# Redux Feedback Loop
I created this project as practice for using Redux and maintaining state between pages/views of a React web application. 

* This project guides a user through a minimalistic set of questions regarding feedback for a day of classes. 
* Through the use of React and Redux the application maintains the client side state as the user moves from one view to the next.
* Once the user has submitted all of the required feedback items, the data is sent to the server and stored in an SQL database.
* In addition to four view related to feedback, there is an admin view (/admin) which shows all feedback and allows the administrator to delete individual items.
